# EAGLE
Code for the building of a metric called EAGLE which quantifies MLB hitter plate discipline

You will need several data files to be able to run this code. All the data comes from the savant API using the baseballr package, 
but I have already condensed this data into rds files in order to make it faster and easier to run. Loading in the data from the api would take a long time. 
Here is the link to the folder containing the data files:

In addition, I have included a PDF file that is what the output of the EAGLE.rmd should look like.
